## Questions:

1. How long does a "Power Pellet" last and how is it awarded? I just assumed it was from the beginning and continuous.  

2. It says that an extra life is given at 10k points. The task is to print "total lives gained" - so, I assume that is either 0 (<10000 points) or 1 (>10000 points).
